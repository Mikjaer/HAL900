Fixed/Won't fix:
Printing sucks: https://bugs.launchpad.net/kicad/+bug/691899

Cvpcb corrupts netlist: https://bugs.launchpad.net/kicad/+bug/692740


EESchema doesn't automatically save the netlist on every edit.

EESchema doesn't automatically annotate non-annotated components when exporting netlist.

EESchema prompts for netlist name.

PCBNew doesn't automatically run cvpcb when footprints are missing.

PCBNew doesn't automatically import the netlist when it changes.

There is no way to lock modules (like mounting holes) so they do not get removed when re-reading the netlist, unless the mounting holes are added to the schematic, perhaps specific handling of loose holes would be good?

kicad spams changes into the pro file, resulting in tons of conflicts and worthles changes:

Dialog box for deleted stale pid file, WTF? I don't give a shit, if it's stale just do your job in stead of
giving me the play-by-play!
